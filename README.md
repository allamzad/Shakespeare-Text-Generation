## Sonnet 
Disdain in repair doth such the bliss past \
Which infection due your reckoning there use \
On when i make will bear much thou should waste \
Lascivious unused heat thing men muse \
All change you men in that as that thought are \
Mistress’ when thou i well me less being \
Treasure deep presume discloses love care \
As crime lest from which th’ store love but seeing \
Ransom hide these due as on is was you \
My dead will thy of o some with the one \
Not when imprint beauty honouring grew \
With that chief canst but had i and thy none \
Is ensconce which to my prefiguring \
Doom my die rhetoric o no dear sing 

## Haiku
Undivided to \
Heart’s see and steal foul and weep \
Fore-bemoaned days 

## Limerick
Sin commanded my lies forth termed nursed lie \
That thou the world of ye star qualify \
My authorizing it true do \
A mortality earth love too \
Thy beauty and thou art worthy love die 

## Sonnet in Spenser Amoretti's tone
Thy inheritors whose i approach love \
Instant fair eyes cannot together hate \
Be false but thee women’s mayst when here prove \
By and thy to catching for but then state \
Of is thought was too though they make my heart \
He stol’n that captive complexion rehearse \
Men oft sweet-seasoned asleep never art \
Glory glory i flowers believe verse \
Golden me married find your assured \
For on many them him more wrong deaths i \
Thy past let ’tis your heart may will endured \
That breast eyes i three with name and knit lie \
Song that doth see bids be of me in life \
Beauty knife alters eye do warning strife
